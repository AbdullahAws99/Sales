# Sales

I started a virtual training journey with MeriSKILL 📊

My first project was to analyze the sales of a store specializing in electronic devices (mobile phones, screens, etc.). In this project, I explain, as usual, the most important ideas and solutions extracted.🌟


The most important questions I extracted:

1- Number of products sold
2- The most profitable products
3- Showing the relationship between the best month, the best quarter, the best hour and the best days for purchase, so that it shows the peak times for products to purchase.
4- Show the effect of the number of quantities sold on profits
5- I wanted to check if I have outlier values, and the best way is to use Box plot or Scatter, here
I used both, but I found Box the best for me💯


The most important answers and suggestions extracted:💡

1- Weekend orders increase after 10 in the morning until 8 in the evening, but it increases significantly after 12, which is the break hour and the whirlpools, and also increases from 7 in the sunset, which is the time when most people are empty and at home.

- I divided the products into price categories to make it easier for me to analyze and extract better ideas

2- The products that bring me the most profit are electronic accessories, especially those that cost between 3 and 15 dollars. This is on the one hand, and the #profit margin in them is greater due to the ease of controlling prices due to offers, discounts, and events.

3- In terms of #revenues, there are laptops and mobile phones, but the profits are very small, but they help in attracting more customers, and this is an opportunity that helps you shop for the rest of the accessories and attachments.

4- The most profitable city is San Francisco, and this results in greater ideas in terms of marketing and starting new products

And thus, God willing, we will finish. Of course, all that I mentioned is just a sliver of this wonderful work. It is really tiring, but great, and it taught me.
A lot of things, marketing and sales👍🏻
